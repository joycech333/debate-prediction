TOM BROKAW: Good evening. Good evening. Love that southern hospitality. Good evening to all of you in the Peace Center for Performing Arts here in Greenville, South Carolina, and to our national television audience as well. This is a very important occasion, obviously. This is the first of the southern primaries in this long election year, one of seven states that will hold primaries or caucuses next Tuesday.
