COKIE ROBERTS: Good evening. We're here tonight in the studios of New Hampshire Public Television. Joining us are five Republican candidates--and one who is not.
They are Gary Bauer (), Senator Orrin Hatch (), Steve Forbes (), John McCain () and Alan Keyes (). Tonight's forum will be divided into the following three categories: first the economy and health care, then foreign affairs, finally social issues and education. And the candidates have chosen their seating order and each question that begins by a draw--who begins each section by a draw.
